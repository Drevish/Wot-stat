        Wot-stat is a system of a quick and simple view of the full information about any World of Tanks player.
        Just simply insert the player's nickname in a search field and system will give you all the available
        information about account or clan you are looking for. <br>
        Information will be given in a form of a table that is colored in a comfy XVM-like way.
        Information about the player will contain all his battle statistics, average parameters per battle,<br>
        calculation of the most important ratings, list of his top-tier tanks, achievements list, clan history etc.<br>
        Wot-stat will be convenient and useful as for common players - for checking and analyzing own statistics,
        as for the clan commanders - for the periodical checking for their bad players, analyzing of candidates that
        want to join the clan and for searching new promising players.<br>
